Roka is a new javascript framework targeting modern web/javascript engines.
Currently it's under basic struction to take advantage of ES5 and wonderful
designed specs of CommonJS. You may check out the other tools I've been
working on, such as jsbuild and domloader.

This is the source code repository for Roka Javascript Framework v1.x
including these directories:
  
  * build: The built files generated from source code
  * doc: Necessary documents such as readme, license, changelog..
  * src: The directory containing source code.
  * test: Consists of a test runner and test suites
